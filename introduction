ARCHITECTURE OF K8S:
C --> clustor
N --> node
p --> pod
C --> container
A --> application

to control/manage we use kubernatis. 





POD: pod is a group of containers, it is a smallest unit of k8s which can deployable. inside we have containers, inside we have application.
the prod can be created on two ways:
1.Imperative     --> we create pods in this method by using commands 
2. Declarative   --> we create pods in this by using MANIFEST file, and the manifest file is in form of YAML file.

here now installing kubernatis by using script file , here we taking ubutu vm and it has many default directories we get while installing, so its
better to create a new directory and install all the set up for k8s in that directory.

mkdir project, in this we work with k8s now.
